Markdown made with [Dilinger.io](https://dillinger.io/)

## Features

- ✨Data table with pagination✨
- ✨Modals, banners and loading bars for mock uploads.✨

Treat this repo as a reference to what different components can be provided by react-native-paper in a plug and play fashion. 

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
- [react-native] - Develop once, deploy to Android and IOS!
- [Hipo](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list-api) - A simple publicly available API to test basic data fetching and pagination


## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd react-native-paper-ui
npm i
npm start
```
